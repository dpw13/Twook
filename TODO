optimizations

background updating of tweets, maybe a switch to Twitter stream ?
display unread tweets on buttons, or at least a signal that it has updated
Only start wireless when necessary
Image cache
retrieve only messages that have not been retrieved before (possible ?)
Additive timeline instead of replacing, up to the last xxx tweets to be decided in settings
API usage caps checks !
